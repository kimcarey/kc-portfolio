        <p>So many people who move to New York want that coveted title of <i>New Yorker</i>, but New York is more than
            the "city that never sleeps." It has a rich history. As someone who grew up in Queens, I wanted to pay
            tribute to the city that I love, so I created this quiz for people to see if they can truly call
            themselves a New Yorker. </p>
        <p><strong>Tech Stack:</strong> Python, Flask, HTML, CSS, Heroku</p>
        <p><strong>Process:</strong> The easy part was compiling the questions and answers. I had to figure out  if I
            should use a Class object, a list, or a dictionary. I ultimately decided on a list of dictionaries. The quiz
            is composed of a total of 8 questions but I needed a larger pool of questions to keep the game fresh if the
            user played multiple times. Questions also had to be randomized, while ensuring the question did not repeat
            during the quiz session. This was the first challenge to solve.

            <p>I knew coming into the project that I didn't want to have users log-in. It was meant to be a simple quiz,
            and while I could use a database to store scores and user data, I chose not to. This presented the next big
            challenge. I needed the program to remember the state in order to keep track of what questions had been
            asked, which question the user was on, and record user responses. Random.seed() was the perfect solution
            for both of these issues. </p>

            <p>Other considerations included the form for the multiple choice questions and unique messages based on the
            total tally of the user's score. I opted to not use any form libraries, but instead built out the form
            in HTML. Once everything was working correctly, the last part was the look of the quiz. I applied CSS and
            focused on simple and clean styling.</p>
